Why blockchain?

* Remove the intermediatory ( It is the direct process no intermediate person or contact is involved)
* Auditability 
* Transparency and trust ( every thing in the blockchain is crystal clear no hidden things are their in blockchain)
* Speed of reconciliation (speed of giving solutions and solving algorithms is very fast)
* Privacy and security( It is very secured even hackers can not hack the datasets this are very much protected my mathematical logics and algorithms very nicely)
